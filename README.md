## About League Plaza

"League Plaza" is a dynamic web platform designed for an imaginary organization called "The League" where adventure and magic intertwine. It serves as a central hub for **Quest Givers** to post thrilling new quests and for daring **Adventurers** to accept these challenges. Beyond the thrill of the hunt, Adventurers can also immerse themselves in the world by renting a variety of mythical mounts for their journeys and acquiring powerful magical items from the League's enchanted store.

This application aims to provide a rich, interactive experience for both quest creation and questing, fostering a vibrant community of heroes and storytellers.
